Sounds like a great project! Here are the general steps you can follow to build this weather application using React, Typescript, and Styled Component:

Sign up for an API key on Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api

Create a new React project using create-react-app: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/

Install the necessary dependencies, including react, react-dom, typescript, styled-components, and axios (for making API requests).

Set up a basic structure for your React app, including creating a new component for the weather app and any necessary child components.

Create a form that allows users to input a city and country for which they want to see the weather forecast.

Set up an API call to Open Weather API using the axios library. Pass in the user's input as parameters in the API call.

Once the API call returns the data, display the relevant weather details on the screen. You can use styled components to format and style the weather information.

Implement error handling in case the user's input is invalid or the API call fails.

Test your app to make sure it's working correctly, and make any necessary adjustments.

Deploy your app to a hosting service like Netlify or Heroku so that others can access it.

Good luck with your project!
